## Model Similarity

How similar is a model of the New York Yankees Baseball team to a model of the Baltimore Orioles?

- Common measure: Kullback-Leibler Divergence.
- More easily interpretable measure: Number of Baltimore-half-innings we would need to simulate in order to correctly reject the model of the Yankees with given confidence level.

## Concept
- We apply statistical methods to _study models_, using simulated data, rather than to study experimental or observational data.
- Models can come from experimental or observational data.
- Beyond baseball, methods can be used with all probabilistic models---but you do need to simulate the models and compute the likelihoods of the simulations.

## Simulate Baseball
- Simulate half-innings with the model of the 2011 Baltimore Orioles, batting at home (Marchi & Albert, 2013):
```{r bbsetup, cache=TRUE}
source('simulation.R')
source('msbaseball.R')
```
```{r bb, echo=TRUE}
sim.baseball(5, BAL, seed=1)
```
- Joint work: Rebeca Berger, American University, Class of 2017.

## Compute log-likelihood-ratios:
```{r klisetup, cache=TRUE}
source('kli.R')
```
```{r likeratios, echo=TRUE}
innings.BAL <- sim.baseball(5, BAL, seed=1)
likes.BAL.BAL <- likes.baseball(innings.BAL,BAL); likes.BAL.BAL
likes.BAL.NYA <- likes.baseball(innings.BAL,NYA); likes.BAL.NYA
like.ratios(likes.BAL.BAL,likes.BAL.NYA)
```
## Baseball Models Require Smoothing
- Some rare transitions for Baltimore are deemed impossible---never happened---for New York.
```{r infinitelr, echo=TRUE}
innings.BAL 
BAL['23X|','3X|']
NYA['23X|','3X|']
```
## Multinomial Model
- Teams do not find themselves in the 23X| state very often, so the sample of transitions from that state, for a given team, in a given season, is small.

```{r transprob, echo=TRUE}
BAL['23X|',BAL['23X|',]!=0]
NYA['23X|',NYA['23X|',]!=0]
```
## Why or Why Not?

- Advantages: provides a measure of similarity between models which may be easier to interpret than the Kullback-Leibler Divergence.

- Disadvantages: harder and less natural to compute than Kullback-Leibler divergence.

## New Model: t(5) and N(0,1)
- For a new model you need to (1) code a simulator:
```{r simt, echo=TRUE}
samples.t5 <- sim.t(5,df=5,seed=7); samples.t5
```
- And (2) code the log-likelihood of two models:
```{r, likest, echo=TRUE}
likes.t5.t5 <- likes.t(samples.t5,df=5); likes.t5.t5
likes.t5.normal <- likes.t(samples.t5,df=Inf); likes.t5.normal
```

## Density Curves: t(5) and N(0,1)

```{r densitycurves}
library(ggplot2)
densitycurve5 <- function(x) {return(dt(x,df=5))}
densitycurveinf <- function(x) {return(dt(x,df=Inf))}
ggplot(NULL,aes(c(-3,3))) +
  geom_area(stat="function",fun=densitycurve5,fill="red",alpha=I(.4),xlim = c(-3,3), show.legend=TRUE) +
  geom_area(stat="function",fun=densitycurveinf,fill="blue",alpha=I(.4),xlim=c(-3,3), show.legend=TRUE) +
  xlab("Data Point") + ylab("Density") + scale_fill_manual(name="df",values=c("red","blue"),labels=factor(c(5,Inf))) +
  theme(legend.position="right")
```
